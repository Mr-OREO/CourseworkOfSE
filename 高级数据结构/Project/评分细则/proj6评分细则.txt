Rubric items: 6

Item 1: 1 point

The cover page must be presented with the title and the date of completion (+ 0.2 pts.).  A complete problem description must be given in Chapter 1 (+0.8 pts.).  Deduct points if:

- the cover page is not complete (-0.2)
- the introduction is a simple copy + paste of the assignment statement (-0.3)
- the introduction is not very clear -- in this chapter they are supposed to make it clear WHAT is to be done, besides why they are doing it (-0.1 ~ 0.5)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 2: 2 points

Chapter 2 is supposed to specify the structure of skip lists (+1 pt.), together with insertion, deletion, and searching (+1 pt.).  Deduct (at most 2) points if:

- the description is way too simple (-1)
- the algorithm specification is not complete – the skip list description is missing (-1)
- the algorithm specification is not complete – the insertion, deletion, and searching descriptions are missing or incomplete (-0.5~1)
- not making their algorithm easier to understand than a simple program (-1)
- only a program + comments, which is not acceptable (-1)
- others – please specify in the final comments.


Item 3: 1 point

The overall style of documentation is supposed to be neat and clear.  Deduct (at most 1) point if:

- the document looks like a patch work (-1)
- messy – some of the data in the charts and tables are missing (-1)
- the hand-in is not zipped with proper folders (-1)
- the hand-in is not complete – some files are missing (-1)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 4: 2 points

A complete table of testing data must be given in Chapter 3, including testing the correctness (+0.5 pt.) and the performance (+1 pt.).  A case generator program must be given to generate large amount of performance testing data (+0.5 pt.).  Deduct  (at most 2) points if:

- the testing results have a problem: some of the tick numbers are less than 10, which means that their answer is not accurate enough (-0.2)
- the case generator program is missing (-0.5)
- the testing results are not complete (-0.5~1)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 5: 7 points

Plots (+2 pts.) and comments (+3 pt.) on the performances of skip list functions are supposed to be given in Chapter 4, together with a proof of the expected time bound (+2 pts.).  Deduct points if:

- the plot is missing (-2)
- the plot is misleading since the x-axis is NOT EQUALLY SPACED (-1)
- the analysis does not seem to fit with their testing results (-1)
- the analysis of the performances is incomplete (-1~3)
- the proof of the expected time bound is missing (-2)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 6: 7 points

A main program (+6 pts.) and a testing program (+1 pt.) must both be presented.  Deduct points if:

- the testing program is missing (-1)
- some of the programs are not working properly (-1 ~ 3)
- the programs are not well-commented (-7)
- others – please specify in the final comments.
