Rubric items: 6

Item 1: 1 point

The cover page must be presented with the title and the date of completion (+ 0.2 pts.).  A complete problem description must be given in Chapter 1 (+0.8 pts.).  Deduct points if:

- the cover page is not complete (-0.2)
- the introduction is a simple copy + paste of the assignment statement (-0.3)
- the introduction is not very clear -- in this chapter they are supposed to make it clear WHAT is to be done, besides why they are doing it (-0.1 ~ 0.5)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 2: 2 points

Chapter 2 is supposed to contain the descriptions of the key data structures (+1 pt.), together with the Huffman algorithm (+1 pt.).  Deduct points if:

- the description is way too simple (-1)
- the algorithm specification is not complete – the key data structure description is missing (-1)
- the algorithm specification is not complete – the Huffman algorithm description is missing (-1)
- not making their algorithm easier to understand than a simple program (-1)
- only a program + comments, which is not acceptable (-1)
- others – please specify in the final comments.


Item 3: 1 point

The overall style of documentation is supposed to be neat and clear.  Deduct (at most 1) point if:

- the document looks like a patch work (-1)
- messy – some of the data in the charts and tables are missing (-1)
- the hand-in is not zipped with proper folders (-1)
- the hand-in is not complete – some files are missing (-1)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 4: 3 points

A complete table of testing data must be given in Chapter 3, including testing the correctness (+1 pts.) and the performance (+2 pts.).  Deduct points if:

- the report contains some test cases, however with no specification on their purposes (-1)
- the report contains some test cases, but there are still bugs missed (-1)
- the testing results are not complete – the correctness testing is missing(-1)
- the report contains a huge amount of input without a generator program (-1)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 5: 3 points

In Chapter 4, analysis of both the time (+1 pt.) and space (+1 pt.) complexities must be given, together with sufficient discussions on the testing results (+1 pt.).  Deduct points if:

- no comments on analyzing the time and/or space complexities (-1~ 2)
- others – please specify in the final comments.

Item 6: 9 points

The programmer is supposed to implement the algorithm.  Deduct points if:

- the program is not working properly (-1 ~ 5)
- the programming style is too messy (-1~ 3)
- the programs are not well-commented (-10)
- others – please specify in the final comments.
